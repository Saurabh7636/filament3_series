Thinking of how to work on activity

-   Every event inside the application should be tracked
-   Need to see if Spatie package can work
-   Check how I can use Filament to display the content
-   Important to plan a clean up thing - don't want to hold up the data for ages
-   Look at what is the best way to show activites in different part of the app

Deal

-   deal is created for a contact
-   deal will have multiple stages (can refer to Hubspot)
-   a deal will have owners and collaborators
-   a deal will have a value
-   deal can have tasks / notes
-   history of all changes to a deal should be visible
-   tasks can be individual
-   reminders will mean everyone gets email

[Deal]

-   deal name
-   contact id

-   owner
-   collaborators
-   value

[Reminders]
